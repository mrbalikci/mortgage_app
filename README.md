# Mortgage Loan App

## Loan Prediction with Neural Network - Machine Learning

### The Question 
A finance company wants to predict a mortgage loan application based on income, loan amount, credit history, gender, marital status, education, dependents, and others. 

How can the company make a good prediction to prevent a financial loss and fraud rate? 

### Approach 

The data set is converted into numerical values in term of creating neural network pipelines. 
Random sampling techniques used to determine if there is overfitting or underfitting. 

### Models and Tests 
* Normal Neural Network TensorFlow
* Random Forest 
* K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
* Support Vector Machine 


### Challenges 
* Properly Undistributed number of observations 
* Selecting proper evaluation metric 
* Handling missing data

### Some of the Details 
* Approximately 86% of applicants not self-employed
* Bad Credit for employed still get the loan approved 
* Loan approval is not depending only on credit score
* The majority loan term is 30 years 

### Libraries / Packages Used 
* Python
* Pandas
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib
* Keras
* TenserFlow
* Scikit-learn
